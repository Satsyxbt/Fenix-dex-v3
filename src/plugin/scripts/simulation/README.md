## Simulation scripts

This directory contains scripts that can be used for simulations using historical data. It is better to run with `localGeth` network, using local geth node in `dev` mode (Built-in hardhat node can be slower and crash due to memory usage).

For large-scale simulations, it is better to use a much more efficient tool: https://github.com/cryptoalgebra/IntegralFeeSimulation
