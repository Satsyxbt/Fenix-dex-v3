This directory contains the periphery smart contracts for the Algebra DEX. For the lower level core contracts, see the `core` directory.

## Slither

*Works correctly starting from the version 0.9.0*

## License

Smart contracts of the periphery are based on [UniswapV3 periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery) and retain the GPL-2.0 or later license.

Contracts have been changed in some places to be compatible with the Algebra Core and use its unique functionality.
