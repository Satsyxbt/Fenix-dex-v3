## Functions
### getPopulatedTicksInWord

```solidity
function getPopulatedTicksInWord(address pool, int16 tickTableIndex) public view returns (struct ITickLens.PopulatedTick[] populatedTicks)
```
**Selector**: `0x351fb478`

Get all the tick data for the populated ticks from a word of the tick bitmap of a pool

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The address of the pool for which to fetch populated tick data |
| tickTableIndex | int16 | The index of the word in the tick bitmap for which to parse the bitmap and fetch all the populated ticks |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| populatedTicks | struct ITickLens.PopulatedTick[] | An array of tick data for the given word in the tick bitmap |

### getClosestActiveTicks

```solidity
function getClosestActiveTicks(address pool, int24 targetTick) public view returns (struct ITickLens.PopulatedTick[2] populatedTicks)
```
**Selector**: `0xec92d7fa`

Get closest initialized ticks around &#x60;targetTick&#x60;

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The address of the pool for which to fetch populated tick data |
| targetTick | int24 | The tick around which the nearest ticks will be searched |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| populatedTicks | struct ITickLens.PopulatedTick[2] | An array of two ticks: before or at `targetTick` and after `targetTick` |

### getNextActiveTicks

```solidity
function getNextActiveTicks(address pool, int24 startingTick, uint256 amount, bool upperDirection) public view returns (struct ITickLens.PopulatedTick[] populatedTicks)
```
**Selector**: `0xc5493f77`

Get all the tick data for the &#x60;amount&#x60; (or less) of populated ticks after &#x60;startingTick&#x60; (including &#x60;startingTick&#x60; itself)

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The address of the pool for which to fetch populated tick data |
| startingTick | int24 | The starting tick index. Must be populated tick |
| amount | uint256 | The maximum amount of ticks requested |
| upperDirection | bool | The direction of search. Will fetch 'next' ticks in direction of price increase if true |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| populatedTicks | struct ITickLens.PopulatedTick[] | An array of tick data for fetched ticks (`amount` or less) |
